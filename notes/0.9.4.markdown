### Fixes

* Numeric characters being escaped by `/` path builder, found and
  fixed by [softprops][softprops]
* Open connections were closed by default after 60 seconds,
  interfering with the streaming API consumption. The default is
  [eliminated][streaming].
  
### Enhancements

* New `configure` method makes it easier to build on Dispatch's
  default AsyncHttpClient configuration.

    val http =
      Http.configure { config: AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder =>
        config.setRequestTimeoutInMs(60000) // keep old default?
      }
