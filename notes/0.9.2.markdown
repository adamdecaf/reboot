[path]: https://github.com/dispatch/reboot/pull/24

### Dependency resolution changes

All Dispatch maven artifact names are now prefixed by `dispatch-`, so
you will need to adjust these (e.g. `dispatch-core`) when
upgrading. The org-id is still `net.databinder.dispatch`.

This release also includes Scala 2.10.0-RC7 artifacts.

### Path builder changes

As part of the path builder change, any slash included in a
path-segment is now passed through unchanged. So for example,

    scala> (host("example.com") / "a/b").url
    res1: java.lang.String = http://example.com/a/b

Characters that are not allowed in a path segment are encoded.

    scala> (host("example.com") / "a b").url
    res2: java.lang.String = http://example.com/a%20b

    scala> (host("example.com") / "a?b").url
    res3: java.lang.String = http://example.com/a%3Fb
